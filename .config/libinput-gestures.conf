# Configuration file for libinput-gestures.
#
# This configuration file is based on the default configuration found
# at /etc/libinput-gestures.conf.
#
# Lines starting with '#' and blank lines are ignored. Currently
# "gesture" and "device" configuration keywords are supported as
# described below. The keyword can optionally be appended with a ":" (to
# maintain compatibility with original format configuration files).
#
# Each gesture line has 3 [or 4] arguments separated by whitespace:
#
# action motion [finger_count] command
#
# where action and motion is either:
#     swipe up
#     swipe down
#     swipe left
#     swipe right
#     swipe left_up
#     swipe left_down
#     swipe right_up
#     swipe right_down
#     pinch in
#     pinch out
#     pinch clockwise
#     pinch anticlockwise
#     hold on (hold gesture available since libinput 1.19)
#
# command is the remainder of the line and is any valid shell command +
# arguments.
#
# finger_count is a single numeric digit and is optional (and is
# typically 3 or 4). If specified then the command is executed when
# exactly that number of fingers is used in the gesture. If not
# specified then the command is executed when that gesture is executed
# with any number of fingers. Gesture lines specified with finger_count
# have priority over the same gesture specified without any
# finger_count.
#
# Typically command will be _internal, or xdotool. See "man xdotool" for
# the many things you can action with that tool. Note that unfortunately
# xdotool does not work with native Wayland clients.

# SWIPE GESTURES:
###############################################################################

# Note the default is an "internal" command that uses wmctrl to switch
# workspaces and, unlike xdotool, works on both Xorg and Wayland (via
# XWayland). It also can be configured for vertical and horizontal
# switching over tabular workspaces, as per the example below. You can
# also add "-w" to the internal command to allow wrapping workspaces.
# Ensure you install wmctrl if you use _internal.

# GNOME SHELL open/close overview using custom keybinding set up in
# dconf-editor. Set org.gnome.shell.keybindings.toggle-overview to
# listen for '<Alt>F1'.
gesture swipe up	xdotool key alt+F1
gesture swipe down	xdotool key alt+F1

# Move to next workspace (works for GNOME/KDE/etc on Wayland and Xorg)
#gesture swipe left	4 _internal ws_down
# gesture swipe left	4 xdotool key super+Page_Down

# Move to prev workspace (works for GNOME/KDE/etc on Wayland and Xorg)
#gesture swipe right	4 _internal ws_up
# gesture swipe right	4 xdotool key super+Page_Up

# Browser go forward (works only for Xorg, and Xwayland clients)
gesture swipe right	4 xdotool key alt+Right

# Browser go back (works only for Xorg, and Xwayland clients)
gesture swipe left	4 xdotool key alt+Left

# Open new browser tag ("hold on" available since libinput 1.19)
# gesture hold on 4 xdotool key control+t

# Optional extended swipe gestures, e.g. for browser tab navigation:
#
# Jump to next open browser tab
# gesture swipe right_up xdotool key control+Tab
#
# Jump to previous open browser tab
# gesture swipe left_up xdotool key control+shift+Tab

# Example to change audio volume:
# Note this only works on an Xorg desktop (not Wayland).
# gesture swipe up   xdotool key XF86AudioRaiseVolume
# gesture swipe down xdotool key XF86AudioLowerVolume

# PINCH GESTURES:
###############################################################################

# GNOME SHELL open/close overview (works for GNOME on Xorg only)
# gesture pinch in	xdotool key super+s
# gesture pinch out	xdotool key super+s

# Optional extended pinch gestures:
# gesture pinch clockwise <whatever command>
# gesture pinch anticlockwise <whatever command>

# This application normally determines your touchpad device
# automatically. Some users may have multiple touchpads but by default
# we use only the first one found. However, you can choose to specify
# the explicit device name to use. Run "libinput list-devices" to work
# out the name of your device (from the "Device:" field). Then add a
# device line specifying that name, e.g:
#
# device DLL0665:01 06CB:76AD Touchpad
#
# If the device name starts with a '/' then it is instead considered as
# the explicit device path although since device paths can change
# through reboots this is best to be a symlink. E.g. instead of specifying
# /dev/input/event12, you should use the corresponding full path link
# under /dev/input/by-path/ or /dev/input/by-id/.
#
# You can choose to use ALL touchpad devices by setting the device name
# to "all". E.g. Do this if you have multiple touchpads which you want
# to use in parallel. This reduces performance slightly so only set this
# if you have to.
#
# device all

###############################################################################
# You can set a minimum travel distance threshold before swipe gestures
# are actioned using the swipe_threshold configuration command.
# Specify this value in dots. The default is 0.
# E.g. set it to 100 dots with "swipe_threshold 100".
# swipe_threshold 0

###############################################################################
# You can set a timeout on gestures from start to end. The default is
# the value commented below. It can be any value in float secs >= 0.
# 0 = no timeout. E.g. set it to 2 secs with "timeout 2".
# timeout 1.5
